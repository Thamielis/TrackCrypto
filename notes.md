Did you know that you can use @github Actions to automate downloading, preprocessing, & merging your data?

These steps can even use the same libraries + tools that you prefer locally (ex: pandas for Python, tidyverse for R, etc.) -- no code changes!

If you're still learning about @GitHub as a platform for automating your machine learning & data science experiments: you can just think of Actions as fancy cron jobs, on infrastructure you don't have to manage.

ex: "Run this code, at this time; and save the results over there."

## Notes

GitHub Actions as "fancy cron jobs, on infrastructure you don't have to manage"
GitHub Actions as "fancy scheduled tasks, on infrastructure you don't have to manage"
